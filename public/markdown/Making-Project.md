### Making an Idea

If you are coming up with a group/project please look through our old repositories first to see if your idea has already been finished by old club members. Some of our projects are in an "Archive" state and if you wish to open/contribute to that code, please contact one of the Developers' Guild Leadership member so we can unarchive the repository.

### Creation/Approval Process

Our approval process is simple and straightforward all you need is to submit a **Project Approval Form** & a **Course Curriculum Sheet**.

#### Project Approval Form

This is located on our Website! Just look for the "Form" button up top!
All we ask is for your name, email, and phone number to contact you if there are errors in your Course Curriculum Sheet or Form. If you already have your Course Curriculum Sheet, you can upload it here as well! (NOTE: It must be in PDF form)
