            <h5>Section 1</h5>
            <br />
            <h4>Why contribute to open source?</h4>
            <p className="text-justify">
                Contributing to open source can be a rewarding way to learn, teach, and build experience in just about any skill you can imagine.
                Why do people contribute to open source? Plenty of reasons!
            </p>
            <h4>Improve software you rely on</h4>
            <p className="text-justify">
                Lots of open source contributors start by being users of software they contribute to. When you find a bug in an open source software you use, you may want to look at the source to see if you can patch it yourself. If that’s the case, then contributing the patch back is the best way to ensure that your friends (and yourself when you update to the next release) will be able to benefit from it.
            </p>
            <h4>
                Improve existing skills
            </h4>
            <p className="text-justify">
                Whether it’s coding, user interface design, graphic design, writing, or organizing, if you’re looking for practice, there’s a task for you on an open source project.
            </p>
            <h4>Meet people who are interested in similar things</h4>
            <p className="text-justify">
                Open source projects with warm, welcoming communities keep people coming back for years. Many people form lifelong friendships through their participation in open source, whether it’s running into each other at conferences or late night online chats about burritos.
            </p>
            <h4>Find mentors and teach others</h4>
            <p className="text-justify">
                Working with others on a shared project means you’ll have to explain how you do things, as well as ask other people for help. The acts of learning and teaching can be a fulfilling activity for everyone involved.
            </p>
            <h4>Build public artifacts that help you grow a reputation (and a career)</h4>
            <p className="text-justify">
                By definition, all of your open source work is public, which means you get free examples to take anywhere as a demonstration of what you can do.
            </p>
            <h4>Learn people skills</h4>
            <p className="text-justify">
                Open source offers opportunities to practice leadership and management skills, such as resolving conflicts, organizing teams of people, and prioritizing work.
            </p>
            <h4>It’s empowering to be able to make changes, even small ones</h4>
            <p className="text-justify">
                You don’t have to become a lifelong contributor to enjoy participating in open source. Have you ever seen a typo on a website, and wished someone would fix it? On an open source project, you can do just that. Open source helps people feel agency over their lives and how they experience the world, and that in itself is gratifying.
            </p>

            <h4>What it means to contribute</h4>

            <blockquote className="blockquote">
                If you’re a new open source contributor, the process can be intimidating. How do you find the right project? What if you don’t know how to code? What if something goes wrong?
            </blockquote>

            <p className="text-justify">
                Not to worry! There are all sorts of ways to get involved with an open source project, and a few tips will help you get the most out of your experience.
            </p>
            <br />

            <h4>You don’t have to contribute code</h4>

            <p className="text-justify">A common misconception about contributing to open source is that you need to contribute code. In fact, it’s often the other parts of a project that are most neglected or overlooked. You’ll do the project a huge favor by offering to pitch in with these types of contributions!</p>
            <p className="text-justify">
                Even if you like to write code, other types of contributions are a great way to get involved with a project and meet other community members. Building those relationships will give you opportunities to work on other parts of the project.

            <h4>You don’t just have to work on software projects!</h4>

            <p className="text-justify">While “open source” often refers to software, you can collaborate on just about anything. There are books, recipes, lists, and classes that get developed as open source projects.</p>
            <p className="text-justify">Even if you’re a software developer, working on a documentation project can help you get started in open source. It’s often less intimidating to work on projects that don’t involve code, and the process of collaboration will build your confidence and experience.</p>
