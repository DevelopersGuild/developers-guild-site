            <h4>How to Contribute to Open Source Developers Guild Projects</h4>
            <p className="text-justify">
                Want to contribute to open source? A guide to making open source contributions, for first-timers and for veterans.
            </p>

            <h5>Section 1</h5>
            <br />
            <h4>Why contribute to open source?</h4>
            <p className="text-justify">
                Contributing to open source can be a rewarding way to learn, teach, and build experience in just about any skill you can imagine.
                Why do people contribute to open source? Plenty of reasons!
            </p>
            <h4>Improve software you rely on</h4>
            <p className="text-justify">
                Lots of open source contributors start by being users of software they contribute to. When you find a bug in an open source software you use, you may want to look at the source to see if you can patch it yourself. If that’s the case, then contributing the patch back is the best way to ensure that your friends (and yourself when you update to the next release) will be able to benefit from it.
            </p>
            <h4>
                Improve existing skills
            </h4>
            <p className="text-justify">
                Whether it’s coding, user interface design, graphic design, writing, or organizing, if you’re looking for practice, there’s a task for you on an open source project.
            </p>
            <h4>Meet people who are interested in similar things</h4>
            <p className="text-justify">
                Open source projects with warm, welcoming communities keep people coming back for years. Many people form lifelong friendships through their participation in open source, whether it’s running into each other at conferences or late night online chats about burritos.
            </p>
            <h4>Find mentors and teach others</h4>
            <p className="text-justify">
                Working with others on a shared project means you’ll have to explain how you do things, as well as ask other people for help. The acts of learning and teaching can be a fulfilling activity for everyone involved.
            </p>
            <h4>Build public artifacts that help you grow a reputation (and a career)</h4>
            <p className="text-justify">
                By definition, all of your open source work is public, which means you get free examples to take anywhere as a demonstration of what you can do.
            </p>
            <h4>Learn people skills</h4>
            <p className="text-justify">
                Open source offers opportunities to practice leadership and management skills, such as resolving conflicts, organizing teams of people, and prioritizing work.
            </p>
            <h4>It’s empowering to be able to make changes, even small ones</h4>
            <p className="text-justify">
                You don’t have to become a lifelong contributor to enjoy participating in open source. Have you ever seen a typo on a website, and wished someone would fix it? On an open source project, you can do just that. Open source helps people feel agency over their lives and how they experience the world, and that in itself is gratifying.
            </p>

            <h4>What it means to contribute</h4>

            <blockquote className="blockquote">
                If you’re a new open source contributor, the process can be intimidating. How do you find the right project? What if you don’t know how to code? What if something goes wrong?
            </blockquote>

            <p className="text-justify">
                Not to worry! There are all sorts of ways to get involved with an open source project, and a few tips will help you get the most out of your experience.
            </p>
            <br />

            <h4>You don’t have to contribute code</h4>

            <p className="text-justify">A common misconception about contributing to open source is that you need to contribute code. In fact, it’s often the other parts of a project that are most neglected or overlooked. You’ll do the project a huge favor by offering to pitch in with these types of contributions!</p>
            <p className="text-justify">
                Even if you like to write code, other types of contributions are a great way to get involved with a project and meet other community members. Building those relationships will give you opportunities to work on other parts of the project.
            </p>

                <li>Offer to mentor another contributor</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>You don’t just have to work on software projects!</h4>

            <p className="text-justify">While “open source” often refers to software, you can collaborate on just about anything. There are books, recipes, lists, and classes that get developed as open source projects.</p>
            <p className="text-justify">Even if you’re a software developer, working on a documentation project can help you get started in open source. It’s often less intimidating to work on projects that don’t involve code, and the process of collaboration will build your confidence and experience.</p>

            <br />
            <h5>Section 3</h5>
            <br />
            <h4>Orienting yourself to a new project</h4>

            <p className="text-justify">For anything more than a typo fix, contributing to open source is like walking up to a group of strangers at a party. If you start talking about llamas, while they were deep in a discussion about goldfish, they’ll probably look at you a little strangely. Before jumping in blindly with your own suggestions, start by learning how to read the room. Doing so increases the chances that your ideas will be noticed and heard.</p>

            <h4>Anatomy of an open source project</h4>
            <p className="text-justify">
                Every open source community is different.
            </p>
            <p className="text-justify">
                Spending years on one open source project means you’ve gotten to know one open source project. Move to a different project, and you might find the vocabulary, norms, and communication styles are completely different.
            </p>
            <p className="text-justify">
                That said, many open source projects follow a similar organizational structure. Understanding the different community roles and overall process will help you get quickly oriented to any new project.
            </p>

            <p className="text-justify">
                A typical open source project has the following types of people:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>Author: The person/s or organization that created the project</li>
                <li>Owner: The person/s who has administrative ownership over the organization or repository (not always the same as the original author)</li>
                <li>Maintainers: Contributors who are responsible for driving the vision and managing the organizational aspects of the project (They may also be authors or owners of the project.)</li>
                <li>Contributors: Everyone who has contributed something back to the project</li>
                <li>Community Members: People who use the project. They might be active in conversations or express their opinion on the project’s direction</li>
            </ul>

            <p className="text-justify">
                Bigger projects may also have subcommittees or working groups focused on different tasks, such as tooling, triage, community moderation, and event organizing. Look on a project’s website for a “team” page, or in the repository for governance documentation, to find this information.
            </p>

            <p className="text-justify">
                A project also has documentation. These files are usually listed in the top level of a repository.
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>LICENSE: By definition, every open source project must have an open source license. If the project does not have a license, it is not open source.</li>
                <li>README: The README is the instruction manual that welcomes new community members to the project. It explains why the project is useful and how to get started.</li>
                <li>CONTRIBUTING: Whereas READMEs help people use the project, contributing docs help people contribute to the project. It explains what types of contributions are needed and how the process works. While not every project has a CONTRIBUTING file, its presence signals that this is a welcoming project to contribute to.</li>
                <li>CODE_OF_CONDUCT: The code of conduct sets ground rules for participants’ behavior associated and helps to facilitate a friendly, welcoming environment. While not every project has a CODE_OF_CONDUCT file, its presence signals that this is a welcoming project to contribute to.</li>
                <li>Other documentation: There might be additional documentation, such as tutorials, walkthroughs, or governance policies, especially on bigger projects.</li>
            </ul>

            <p className="text-justify">Finally, open source projects use the following tools to organize discussion. Reading through the archives will give you a good picture of how the community thinks and works.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Issue tracker: Where people discuss issues related to the project.</li>
                <li>Pull requests: Where people discuss and review changes that are in progress.</li>
                <li>Discussion forums or mailing lists: Some projects may use these channels for conversational topics (for example, “How do I…“ or “What do you think about…“ instead of bug reports or feature requests). Others use the issue tracker for all conversations.</li>
                <li>Synchronous chat channel: Some projects use chat channels (such as Slack or IRC) for casual conversation, collaboration, and quick exchanges.</li>
            </ul>

            <br />
            <h5>Section 4</h5>
            <br />
            <h4>How to submit a contribution</h4>

            <blockquote className="blockquote">
                You’ve found a project you like, and you’re ready to make a contribution. Finally! Here’s how to get your contribution in the right way.
            </blockquote>

            <h4>Communicating effectively</h4>
            <p className="text-justify">
            Whether you’re a one-time contributor or trying to join a community, working with others is one of the most important skills you’ll develop in open source.
            </p>
            <p className="text-justify">
            Before you open an issue or pull request, or ask a question in chat, keep these points in mind to help your ideas come across effectively.
            </p>

            <p className="text-justify">
            Give context. Help others get quickly up to speed. If you’re running into an error, explain what you’re trying to do and how to reproduce it. If you’re suggesting a new idea, explain why you think it’d be useful to the project (not just to you!).
            </p>

            <p className="text-justify">
            Do your homework beforehand. It’s OK not to know things, but show that you tried. Before asking for help, be sure to check a project’s README, documentation, issues (open or closed), mailing list, and search the internet for an answer. People will appreciate when you demonstrate that you’re trying to learn.
            </p>

            <p className="text-justify">
            Keep requests short and direct. Much like sending an email, every contribution, no matter how simple or helpful, requires someone else’s review. Many projects have more incoming requests than people available to help. Be concise. You will increase the chance that someone will be able to help you.
            </p>

            <p className="text-justify">
            Keep all communication public. Although it’s tempting, don’t reach out to maintainers privately unless you need to share sensitive information (such as a security issue or serious conduct violation). When you keep the conversation public, more people can learn and benefit from your exchange. Discussions can be, in themselves, contributions.
            </p>

            <p className="text-justify">
            It’s okay to ask questions (but be patient!). Everybody was new to the project at some point, and even experienced contributors need to get up to speed when they look at a new project. By the same token, even longtime maintainers are not always familiar with every part of the project. Show them the same patience that you’d want them to show to you.
            </p>

            <p className="text-justify">
            Respect community decisions. Your ideas may differ from the community’s priorities or vision. They may offer feedback or decide not to pursue your idea. While you should discuss and look for compromise, maintainers have to live with your decision longer than you will. If you disagree with their direction, you can always work on your own fork or start your own project.
            </p>

            <p className="text-justify">
            Above all, keep it classy. Open source is made up of collaborators from all over the world. Context gets lost across languages, cultures, geographies, and time zones. In addition, written communication makes it harder to convey a tone or mood. Assume good intentions in these conversations. It’s fine to politely push back on an idea, ask for more context, or further clarify your position. Just try to leave the internet a better place than when you found it.
            </p>

            <h4>Gathering context</h4>

            <p className="text-justify">
            Before doing anything, do a quick check to make sure your idea hasn’t been discussed elsewhere. Skim the project’s README, issues (open and closed), mailing list, and Stack Overflow. You don’t have to spend hours going through everything, but a quick search for a few key terms goes a long way.
            </p>

            <p className="text-justify">
            If you can’t find your idea elsewhere, you’re ready to make a move. If the project is on GitHub, you’ll likely communicate by opening an issue or pull request:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>Issues are like starting a conversation or discussion</li>
                <li>Pull requests are for starting work on a solution</li>
                <li>For lightweight communication, such as a clarifying or how-to question, try asking on Stack Overflow, IRC, Slack, or other chat channels, if the project has one</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Before you open an issue or pull request, check the project’s contributing docs (usually a file called CONTRIBUTING, or in the README), to see whether you need to include anything specific. For example, they may ask that you follow a template, or require that you use tests.</p>
            <p>If you want to make a substantial contribution, open an issue to ask before working on it. It’s helpful to watch the project for a while (on GitHub, you can click “Watch” to be notified of all conversations), and get to know community members, before doing work that might not get accepted.</p>
