### Description

Interview prep is a career-oriented group focused on preparing for technical interview questions. If you are a career-minded developer looking to get a head start on landing internships and jobs with tech companies, then this is the place to be!

It is recommended for new members to have experience coding in at least one language, and very basic knowledge of object-oriented programming. Many of the topics we cover are similar to those taught in CIS 22C at De Anza. These include

- Linked Lists
- Big-O Notation
- Stacks and Queues
- Hashtables and Hashsets
- Sorting Algorithms
- Trees and Graphs

We explain these topics enough to start solving some basic coding problems that are often brought up in real interviews.
