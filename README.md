### Start Application
```sh 
  # install application depedencies
  yarn
  # Watch File Changes and Start Development Server 
  yarn loftly:watch
```
### If loftly:watch fails
try running the re:build script 
and reinstalling dependencies this 
usually helps with a clean build. 

### Build Application 
```sh 
  yarn loftly:build
  ## alternatively you can run 
  yarn re:build
  yarn build
```
